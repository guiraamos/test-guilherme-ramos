John as an advertiser would like to know how much it costs to advertise, so that
he can make its investment decision. John would like to be able to filter by 
aspect ratio (16: 9 ...) and Normal or Cheap Prices.

Requirement: Create a screen that contains an aspect ratio filter, another filter for
cheap and normal price and a button to calculate the price.

Details:

1. Create an API that will show the different types of aspect-ratios. Take in 
mind that in our BD we have this data in pixels, so  you must convert the data 
from pixel to aspect-ratio


2. Based on advertiser filter, calculate the price;


Formats options: 16: 9, 9:16

Possible results:

16: 9 & & Cheap: $ 7.00
16: 9 & & Normal: $ 14.00

9:16 && Cheap: $ 18.00
9:16 & & Normal: $ 22.00
